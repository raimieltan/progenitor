 Guidelines for pushing changes, pulling updates from the main repository, and creating pull requests. Here's a step-by-step document outlining the process:

1. **Clone the repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```

git clone <repository-url>

```

  

2. **Create a branch**: Switch to a new branch for your feature or bug fix. It's good practice to name the branch based on the feature or issue you're addressing. Use the following command to create a new branch:

2. **Create a branch**: Switch to a new branch for your feature or bug fix. It's good practice to name the branch based on the feature or issue you're addressing. Use the following command to create a new branch:

```

git checkout -b <branch-name>

```

  

3. **Make changes**: Make the necessary changes to the code or add new files to your project.

  

4. **Stage and commit your changes**: Stage the files you want to commit using the following command:

```

git add <file1> <file2> ...

```

You can also use `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory.

Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:

```

git commit -m "Your commit message"

```

  

5. **Pull latest changes**: Before pushing your changes, it's important to pull the latest updates from the main repository. Use the following command:

```

git pull origin main

```

Resolve any conflicts, if present, and ensure your changes work well with the latest code.

  

6. **Push your branch**: Once your changes are ready, push your branch to the remote repository using the following command:

```

git push origin <branch-name>

```

  

7. **Create a pull request**: Go to the repository on GitHub and create a new pull request. Select your branch as the source branch and the main branch as the target branch. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, outlining the changes you made.

  

8. **Review and address feedback**: Collaborators and maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. Make any necessary changes and push them to your branch.

  

9. **Merge the pull request**: Once your pull request has been approved and all feedback has been addressed, it's time to merge your changes into the main branch. Use the "Merge" button on the pull request page to incorporate your changes.

  

10. **Pull the latest changes**: Finally, pull the latest changes from the main repository to your local machine using the following command:

```

git pull origin main

```
